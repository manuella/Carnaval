# Notes:
#
#   - A subset of the NBT Session Service is maintained as an artifact in
#     SMB Naked TCP transport (what Microsoft calls "TCP Direct") over
#     port 445.  Specifically, Naked TCP transport uses a four-byte header
#     per-message to identify the length of the following message.  The
#     difference is that in NBT 17 bits are used for the length, whereas
#     24 bits are available (until/unless Microsoft changes the rules) in
#     naked TCP.
#
# ToDo:
#
#   - Write a genereric dump() function that parses an array of 4 bytes (or
#     allows for 10 in the case of the Redirect Response) and pretty-prints
#     the parsed output.
#
#   - More doctests?

"""NetBIOS over TCP/UDP (NBT) protocol: Session Service

NBT is defined in IETF RFCs 1001 and 1002, collectively known as IETF
Standard 19 (STD19).  A detailed implementer's guide to NBT can be found
on the web at:
  http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/NetBIOS.html#NBT.6

The NBT Session Service is probably the simplest aspect of the NBT
transport suite.  It consists of only six possible messages, half of which
fit compactly in only 4 bytes:

    * Session Message
    * Session Request
    * Positive Session Response
    * Negative Session Response
    * Retarget Session Response
    * Session Keepalive

The Session Message is a header used to identify the length of a subsequent
message (e.g., an SMB message, though NBT can be a transport for lots of
things).  The remaining messages are complete unto themselves and interact
only minimally with next layer protocols (such as SMB).

The NBT Session Service is simple enough that it is implemented here as a
set of functions, not classes.  In some cases, the functions just retrn a
constant value.

CONSTANTS:

  Protocol Details:
    SS_PORT = 139   : The default NBT Session Service TCP listener port.

  Message Types:
    SS_SESSION_MESSAGE    : A four-byte header indicating the length, in
                            bytes, of the message (belonging to another
                            protocol) that follows.
    SS_SESSION_REQUEST    : Sent from the client (calling node) to a
                            server (called node) over an existing TCP
                            session to request the start of a NetBIOS
                            session.
    SS_POSITIVE_RESPONSE  : Response from the called node back to the
                            calling node to indicate that a Session
                            Request was granted.
    SS_NEGATIVE_RESPONSE  : Indicates that a Session Request was denied.
    SS_RETARGET_RESPONSE  : A rarely-used message that instructs the
                            to retry the connection using a new IP
                            address and/or port number.
    SS_SESSION_KEEPALIVE  : The pig in the pipeline.

  Error codes:
    SS_ERR_NOT_LISTENING  : Not Listening On Called Name
                            The name is registered, but no application
                            or service is listening for session
                            connection requests on that name.
    SS_ERR_NOT_ANSWERING  : Not Listening For Calling Name
                            The name is registered, and the service is
                            listening for connections, but it doesn't
                            want to talk to you.  It is probably
                            expecting a call from some other node.
    SS_ERR_NOT_PRESENT    : Called Name Not Present
                            The remote node has not even registered the
                            CALLED NAME.
    SS_ERR_INSUFFICIENT   : Insufficient Resources
                            The remote node is busy and cannot take your
                            call at this time.
    SS_ERR_UNSPECIFIED    : Unspecified Error
                            Something is wrong on the far end, but we
                            are not quite sure what the problem is.

  Notes:  Client implementations generally ignore Retarget Response

          are, of course, some really bad things that can happen (think of
