#   _HEX_XLATE  - String used to convert a nibble into a hex digit character.

def hexnum2str( numbr=None, width=0 ):
  """Format an integer value as a string in hexadecimal notation.

  Input:  numbr - The number to be formatted as a string.
          width - The minimum width of the formatted portion of the
                  resulting string.

  Output: A string in the form [-]0xX..., where "[-]" is an optional
          minus sign that will be present if <numbr> is negative, and
          "X..." is the formatted portion of the resulting string,
          which is the hexadecimal representation of abs( <numbr> ).

  Doctest:
    >>> print hexnum2str( -0xABCDEF, 8 )
    -0x00ABCDEF

  """Convert bytes into two-character hex strings.

  Input:  data  - A string, the first byte of which will be used to
                  generate the output.  This must be readable as type
                  str.

  Output: A two-byte string representing the hex value of first byte
          of the input.  For example: '\\t' --> '09'.

  Errors:
    AssertionError  - Raised if the input is not of type <str>.
    ValueError      - Raised if the input string is empty.  We need at
                      least (and will use at most) one byte.

  Notes:  This function converts the input byte into a two-character
          hex string, whether or not the input byte is a printable
          character.  The output is always a two hex-digit pair, and
          never an escape sequence (e.g., never '\\t' for TAB).

  Input:  data  - The string of bytes to convert.  The input must be of
                  type <str>.  The empty string is acceptable.

  Output: A string in which nonprinting characters in the original
          string will be represented using "\\xXX" notation.

  Errors:
    AssertionError  - Raised if the input is not of type str.

  Notes:  This is similar to the standard binascii.b2a_hex() function,
          except that it doesn't produce single-character escape
          sequences (e.g., "\\t").  All of the escapes are in the
          "\\xXX" format.

          This function operates on octet strings only.  NetBIOS does
          not understand Unicode.  Sorry.

                11/how-do-i-compare-two-different-netbios-names.aspx

          You can convert Unicode strings to the <str> format using the
          .encode() method and your preferred encoding scheme.

                    This is the same as the input to <hexstr()>.
          linemax - Maximum length of the resulting chunks.  This value

  Output: A list of strings, none of which are more than <linemax>
          bytes in length.  Any given string may be up to three bytes
