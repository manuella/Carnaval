"""Carnaval Toolkit: SMB NTSTATUS codes (error codes).

This module encapsulates the Windows NT return codes, aka., NTSTATUS
codes, that are used by SMB.  It provides methods for looking up
NTSTATUS values by name or code number, and for parsing out NTSTATUS
code subfields.

Notes:
  Early (pre-NT) versions of SMB used a different (now deprecated)
  error code format.
"""

# Internal Data -------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
#   _init_dict      - Maps NTSTATUS codes to their associated names and
#                     descriptions.  This is the "user friendly"
#                     representation.  The goal is to make it easy to
#                     read, add, and update entries.  The <_init_dict>
#                     dictionary is only used at start-up, and is deleted
#                     as soon as <_ntstatus_dict> has been generated.
#   _ntstatus_dict  - Maps NTSTATUS codes *and names* to a tuple that
#                     includes the code, name, and description.  This is
#                     the dictionary that is actually used at run-time.
